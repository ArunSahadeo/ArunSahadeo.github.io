![Young Frankenstein](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ca/dd/c9/caddc9872c2de2be42e0965cbbfc0ca9.gif "Young Frankenstein")

After much deliberation and head-scratching, I have managed to churn out a passable portfolio site.

I decided to build this site on [Jekyll][jekyll-site]{:target="_blank"} and host it on [GitHub Pages][github-pages]{:target="_blank"}, as the latter offers free hosting, whilst the former offers me the flexibility and scalability I need.

Granted, I will probably overhaul entire sections of this site before too long, but this should suffice for now.

Watch this space, as I intend to regularly update the site.

[jekyll-site]: https://jekyllrb.com
[github-pages]:   https://pages.github.com/
