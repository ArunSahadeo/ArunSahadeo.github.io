It's important to realise that, as developers, our journey to learn more every day will never end.

At the same time, I can understand how daunting it is for those new to this field to sift through all the information and formulate a learning plan.

With this in mind, I have come up with a short list of online learning resources that I think are well suited to beginners:

### [W3 Schools][w3schools]{:target="_blank"}

Granted, it doesn't have the best of reputations, but I still think this is an invaluable resource to those looking to learn from scratch, or even for those needing a quick primer on the basics.

### [Codecademy][codecademy]{:target="_blank"}

They have courses on a wide range of topics and programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, data science fundamentals using SQL &amp; Python and, more recently, how to build Android apps in Java.

### [Dash General Assembly][dash_ga]{:target="_blank"}

Dash General Assembly has some great web development tutorials for beginners, giving you a particular insight into how to create basic layouts using CSS.

### [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)][mdn]{:target="_blank"}

What better place is there to learn than from one of the tech giants responsible for defining and shaping the web standards that decide how our HTML is rendered in the browser, how our CSS is displayed and how our JavaScript interacts with the user?

### [Freecodecamp][freecodecamp]{:target="_blank"}

Although I never completed any of the FCC courses, from what I remember, their courses were very much project oriented, thus giving learners a firm understanding as to how they can apply their programming skills to real world projects.

### [Khan Academy][khanacademy]{:target="_blank"}

Disclaimer: I have not had a look at any of the programming courses on this site.

However, given the quality of the maths and science courses I've taken on their site, I give you my word that you will not be disappointed.

### YouTube

There are some great YouTube channels out there, here are a few favourites:

#### [HowToCodeWell][peterfisher]{:target="_blank"}

Peter Fisher is a great tutor for those aiming to learn the very basics.

#### [Traversy Media][traversymedia]{:target="_blank"}

Traversy Media is a great resource for those looking to quickly learn the latest and most widely adopted technologies.
