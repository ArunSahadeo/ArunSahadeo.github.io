## What is it?

STEMLive is a website that allows people to find STEM content creators on video streaming platforms including Twitch and YouTube.

## How and why was it built?

Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

I like to build things that I can envision myself using, and being a frequent visitor to many of the channels promoted by STEMLive, I wanted to find a way of enhancing their reach and bring them to new audiences.

## How do I find it?

You can find it on the following [link][stemlive_link]
